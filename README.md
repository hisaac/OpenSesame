# OpenSesame

OpenSesame was an app for opening links in macOS apps instead of the web browser.

## ⚠️ OpenSesame is no longer under active development ⚠️

This was a really fun project to work on, but I will no longer be actively developing on the project. I'm leaving it here in case there is any code that could still be useful to others.

If you're looking for something like OpenSesame that _is_ still being developed, I'll direct you to [OpenIn](https://loshadki.app/openin/). It does most of what I had planned for OpenSesame to do, and then some.

## Currently supported Links/Apps

- Twitter links → Twitter.app
- Apple Music and iTunes links → Music.app
- Mac App Store links → Mac App Store
- Zoom links → Zoom

OpenSesame is also smart enough to expand shortlinks before attempting to open an app.

## Planned integrations

- Apple News → Web Browser
- Discord → Discord.app
- Spotify → Spotify.app
- Twitter → Tweetbot.app & Twitterrific.app
- Slack → Slack.app

## Known Issues

- Clicking links in Twitter.app will sometimes present an error window before opening in your browser as expected.
- Links handled by the browser sometimes open in the background when they should open in the foreground.

## Development

Please reach out if you would like to contribute! I don't have as much time as I'd like to work on this, so progress is slow. I'd love any help others could provide.

### ToDo

- Planned integrations (above)
- Add Settings UI
	- Add configuration of default fallback browser
	- Add ability to open certain types of links in different browsers/apps (hostname and regex matching)
	- Use an `NSPredicateEditor` to build rules
	- Customize shortlink handler with custom hostnames
	- Set OpenSesame as default browser from Settings UI
- Perhaps utilize Tim Johnsen's [OpenerManifest](https://github.com/timonus/OpenerManifest/) to help determine link types
- Speed up shortlink resolution
- Determine foreground/background state through `NSEvent`s
- Safari Extension
	- Other browsers too? (if possible)
- Migrate to [Tuist](https://github.com/tuist/tuist)
- Get a better app icon
